# PlanetService

The service provides an external WebAPI for getting data about the planet and its current research, buildings, ships, defensive weapons.
And also to create and manage them through interaction with other services.

**Methods used:**
1. ResourcesService
- Getting data on the current resources of the planet, storage capacity and the level of resource growth.
- Updating the storage capacity, the amount of resources and the level of resource growth.
2. BuilderService
- Get current queue
- Adding and canceling a queue.
3. CatalogService
- Getting a list of buildings (type + description)
- Getting details of each building/research/ship.
- Getting the dependencies of the selected building/research/ships.
4. FleetService
- Getting the result of the battle for both sides (ships, guns, resources)

**Provided Methods:**
1. BuilderService
- Notification that the building/ship/cannons are completed.

#### Logic:
If the user wants to build any of the buildings, he calls the PlanetService. Retrieves building types and parameters via the CatalogService. Checks if there is a build queue for this via BuilderSerivce. It then gets the current state of the resources through the ResourceService. Then, if there are enough resources to build this building, the build process in the BuilderService is started. Once the BuilderService has finished building, it will notify PlanetService and an entry will be added to the **Constructions** table.  
**MilitaryConstructions** will be added following the same logic.  
**Ð¡oefficient table** will be stored by PlanetService and when it changes, ResourcesService will be notified about it.
